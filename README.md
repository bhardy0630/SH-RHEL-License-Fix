# SH-RHEL-License-Fix
 Bash script - Changes RHEL Classic "SystemID File style" licensing to the new "subscription-manager" type. RHEL 7 comes this way by default.
 However RHEL 5 and 6 can be provisioned in the classic style.
# Description
 RHEL licensing systemid file (A.K.A "Classic") to subscription-manager - type fix script.
 Should be a "wget and run" type script for fixing RHEL licensing - since we're using the new licensing system 
 then we might as well make it as automated as possible!
 This is actually my first bash script, so feel free to tell me how to do it better!
